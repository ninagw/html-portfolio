<h1>The best books I read in 2023</h1>

<h2>My top 3 picks.</h2>

<hr />

<h3>Butter</h3>
<p>Placed in Japan. Really enjoyed diving in the culture and the writing of the author.</p>

<h3>Der Papierpalast</h3>
<p>Perfect summer novel! Dreamed away by the scenery at the sea. Started me thinking about my future goals and expanded my vision board.</p>

<h3>Circe</h3>
<p>Different read for me because it's placed in the world of gods which was new to me. But thanks to the writing skills of the author I could really live in this world and feel the struggle of Circe.</p>
